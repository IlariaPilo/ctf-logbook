### fcrackzip
A tool to efficiently bruteforce the password of a zip file. If you want to run a dictionary attack, you might be interested in downloading `rockyou.txt` [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt&ved=2ahUKEwjqwajX_LyIAxVtR_EDHZm6PW4QFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3snAERl1mU6Ccr4WFEazBd).
```sh
# to run a dictionary attack 
fcrackzip -v -D -p rockyou.txt -u target.zip
```

### exiftool
Useful to read the metadata of a file
```sh
exiftool target.pdf
```

### Audacity
The software to use when dealing with audio data. It automatically:
- displays the spectrogram (next to the name of the track, click `...` > `Spectrogram`);
- displays the frequency plot (`Analyze` > `Plot Spectrum`);
- changes the pitch and speed (right click on the track, then `Pitch and Speed`).

It can be used to do many more complex things, take a look at the [resources](./resources.md) to see some examples.
